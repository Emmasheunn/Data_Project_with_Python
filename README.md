# Data Project with Python
### Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
**Welcome to my project workflow with Python ðŸš€**

Iâ€™m thrilled to be starting a hands-on project where Iâ€™ll be leveraging a suite of powerful tools to bring ideas to life:

ðŸ”¹ **Cloud database** â€“ for real-time data storage and scalability
ðŸ”¹ **Power BI** â€“ for impactful, dynamic visualizations
ðŸ”¹ **Python** (with `pandas`, `NumPy`, `requests`, and more) â€“ for analysis and automation
ðŸ”¹ **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for flexible exploration and storytelling
ðŸ”¹ **Notion** â€“ to plan, document, and track everything in one place
ðŸ”¹ **draw\.io** â€“ for designing workflows and systems visually

This is a chance to put both technical and project management skills into action, and Iâ€™ll be sharing progress and learnings along the way.

Hereâ€™s a peek at my project planning space on Notion:

Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow! ðŸ’¡

Once your Notion page is set to "Public" and you have the shareable link, you can replace `[Insert your Notion public link here]` with it directly.

Would you like help creating a simple, polished cover image or banner to go along with this post? It could include icons for the tools youâ€™re using.
