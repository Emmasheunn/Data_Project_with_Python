# Data Project with Python
### Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
**Welcome to my project workflow with Python ðŸš€**

#### As part of my learn-as-you-build initiative, Iâ€™m thrilled to be starting a hands-on project where Iâ€™ll be leveraging a suite of powerful tools to bring ideas to life:

ðŸ”¹ **Cloud database** â€“ for real-time data storage and scalability

ðŸ”¹ **Power BI** â€“ for impactful, dynamic visualizations

ðŸ”¹ **Python** (with `pandas`, `NumPy`, `requests`, and more) â€“ for analysis and automation

ðŸ”¹ **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for flexible exploration and storytelling

ðŸ”¹ **Notion** â€“ to plan, document, and track everything in one place

ðŸ”¹ **draw.io** â€“ for designing workflows and systems visually

This is a chance to put both technical and project management skills into action, and Iâ€™ll be sharing progress and learnings along the way.

Hereâ€™s a peek at my project planning space on Notion:

Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow! ðŸ’¡
